# Dynamic Arena FMS

    - grant each host a 10.0.100.xxx IP for communication
    - perform FMS actions
    - generate matches
    - handle scoring ingress

The idea is to use a managed switch to assign VLANs to each server to prevent interference. This project is designed around a Cisco Catalyst 3500 series switch, but any managed switch will work.

## For Open source

We hope to merge our updated frontend with upstream once it is finished.
